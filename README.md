# React Native Uninitialized State/Prop Access

This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native applications: attempting to access a state variable or prop before it has been fully initialized. This often results in unexpected behavior or crashes, especially when dealing with asynchronous data fetching.

## Problem:
The `UninitializedState.js` file shows a component that tries to render data before the asynchronous operation (`setTimeout` simulating data fetching) completes. This leads to attempting to access `data` while it's still `null`.

## Solution:
The `UninitializedStateSolution.js` file presents a corrected version. It uses a conditional rendering approach, only rendering the data after the `isLoading` state variable becomes `false`, indicating that the data has been successfully fetched.
