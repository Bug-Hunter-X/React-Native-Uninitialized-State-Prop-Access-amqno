This error occurs when you try to access a state variable or prop before it has been fully initialized.  This commonly happens in React Native components when you try to render something that depends on data that hasn't loaded yet.  The specific error message might not be immediately obvious; it could manifest as unexpected behavior, a blank screen, or another subtle error.
